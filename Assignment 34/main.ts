//Assignment 34, Pizzas

//Store the pizza names in a array
let pizzaFlavor : string[] = ["Chicken fajita pizza" , "Ranch Piazza" , "Smooky BBQ pizza"];

//craete a loop that prints the name of pizza
for (let i = 0; i < pizzaFlavor.length; i++){
    console.log(pizzaFlavor[i])
};

//Modify loop to print a sentence instead of name of flavor
for (let i = 0; i < pizzaFlavor.length; i++) {
    console.log(`I really like ${pizzaFlavor[i]}!`)
};

//print the statement about how much you like pizza ?
console.log("\n I really like pizza so much because of thier creamy,cheesy and spicy flavours. These are my favorite flavours. There are so much toppings on a pizza and we need add toppings of our choice. We can also try some fusion with flavours. I really love pizza so much.")
